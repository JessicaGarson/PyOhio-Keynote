# PyOhio Keynote
This repository contains code, slides, and resources for the 2025 PyOhio Keynote, “The right vibe: the role of community in the age of AI”. This talk examines the increasing demand for robust programming communities in response to the growing prevalence of AI tools.  

The code contained in this repository was generated using Windsurf and Claude 4.0.

## Prompts
### Demo 1
Can you create a straightforward Flask app that displays 'Hello PyOhio'? I'd like this to have a modern look.

### Demo 2
Can you expand this application to use vector search with Elasticsearch. I have already set environment variables in my terminal for ELASTICSEARCH_HOST and ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY.
